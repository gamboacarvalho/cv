New curricular plan for MPD 2016, quiny provides a tiny implementation of the class `Queryable<T>`, 
equivalent to java 8 `Stream<T>`. 
`Queryable<T>` is a concise and functional implementation of an equivalent API to the `Stream<T>`,
which preserves the internal iteration approach, the laziness behavior and the fluent idiom. This solution answers the question: How can I implement a lazy iterator in Java 8?
