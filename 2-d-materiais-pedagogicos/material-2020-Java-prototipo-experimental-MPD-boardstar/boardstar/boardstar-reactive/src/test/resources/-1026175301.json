To succeed, such heroes will need skill and weaponry, courage and faith and even the assistance of ancient and powerful relics. Relic is an adventure board game based on the Talisman system, in which two to four players each assume the role of a powerful hero from the Warhammer 40,000 universe and bravely venture forth to shield the Antian Sector from certain doom.
