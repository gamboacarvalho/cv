### Description

Internet applications, such as Email, VoIP and WWW, have been enhanced with many features. However, the introduction and modification of features may result in undesired behaviors, and this effect is known as feature interaction-FI.
In this project we research a new representation scheme of features, based on group theory, that allows the detection of feature pairs candidate for FI. Moreover, the new representation scheme of features aims at the identification of the hypothetical features, which may be candidate for FI under a set of possible events and inconsistency rules.

We investigate a new proactive approach to FI, based on the security analysis of features. Given one feature, one set of possible events that may be generated in the system lifetime and the conditions that reveal a FI, we ask ourselves in what cases another feature would make FIs occur with the given feature. This approach has the advantage of highlighting, in advance, the FI that may occur when subscribing new features and take the necessary precautions in advance in the FI resolution methods.
