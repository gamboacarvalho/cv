### Description
Internet applications, such as Email, VoIP and WWW, have been enhanced with many features. However, the introduction and modification of features may result in undesired behaviors, and this effect is known as feature interaction-FI. We describe a distributed FI resolution, based on advisers. The adviser follows deontic rules and is implemented with Java technology. In case of failure of one Internet node, message processing is not compromised. Our proposal was customized and tested to James Email server, and the results satisfy main requirements and do not compromise performance.
