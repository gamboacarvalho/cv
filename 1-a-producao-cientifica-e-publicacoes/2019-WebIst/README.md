### Description
Over the past decades, templates views have been the most used approach to build dynamic HTML pages. Simply put, a template engine (such as JSP, Handlebars, Thymleaf, and others) generates HTML by merging templates with given data models. Yet, this process may turn impractical for large data sets that postpone the HTML resolution until all data become available to the engine. This behavior results in poor user experience preventing the browser to render the end user-interface. In this paper we introduced the concept of higherorder templates (HoT) provided in Java implementation of HtmlFlow, which allows HTML to be resolved on demand as data becomes available. This lets the user-interface to be rendered incrementally by the browser in line with the availability of the data. Finally we also show some advantages of HtmlFlow over state of the art front-end frameworks such as ReactJS.
