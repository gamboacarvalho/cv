### Description
Current Software Transactional Memory (STM) implementations typically incur both into memory overheads that are proportional to the number of transactional locations used by a program, and into performance overheads when accessing any of those transactional locations. Such overheads render the use of STMs for the entire heap of a real-sized application impractical.
In this paper we propose an STM implementation that reduces substantially both the memory and the performance overheads associated with transactional locations that are not under contention. Therefore, assuming that the number of transactional locations that may be under contention is only a small fraction of the total memory managed by a real-sized application, the overheads introduced by the STM become residual.
