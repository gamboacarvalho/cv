### Description
Likewise older Internet applications, such as Email and VoIP, the creation of greater number of WWW services make inevitable the occurrence of undesirable feature interactions. The feature resolution on WWW must follow the basic constraints of Internet and, therefore, must be distributed. In this paper we provide a brief introduction of feature interaction problem. Then, we depict one architecture to resolve the feature interactions and, finally, present an implementation of feature interaction resolution advisor based on deontic logics and Java.
