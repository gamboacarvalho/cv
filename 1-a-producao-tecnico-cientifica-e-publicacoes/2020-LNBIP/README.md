### Description
For the last decades text-based templates have been the primary option to build dynamic web pages. Until today, no other alternative has rebutted this approach. Yet, using text-based templates has several drawbacks including: 1. blocking resolution, 2. programming languages heterogeneity, 3. limited set of templating features and 4. opinionated idioms. In this paper we show how a domain specific language (DSL) for HTML (such as HtmlFlow, Kotlinx.html or React JSX) can suppress the text-based templates limitations and outperform state-of-the-art template engines (such as JSP, Handlebars, Thymeleaf, and others) in well known benchmarks. To that end, we use the Spring Framework and the sample application PetClinic to show how a DSL for HTML provides unopinionated web templates with boundless resolving features only ruled by the host programming language (such as Java, Kotlin or JavaScript).
